# SIML â€” Simulation Modeling Language

**SIML** is a declarative programming language for building agent-based simulations, synthetic data environments, and LLM-driven workflows. Designed for structured reasoning, training, and evaluation of autonomous agents, SIML combines YAML-style clarity with real-time event-driven behavior modeling.

## âœ¨ Features

- Declarative `state:`, `actions:`, `rules:`, `agents:`, and `synthesize:` sections
- Tick-based simulation loop with logging, tracing, and state mutation
- Structured `prompt:` and `result:` handling for LLM integration
- Agent support with context-based decision-making and action calling
- Portable syntax, CLI runner, and MCP-compatible runtime

## ðŸ›  Getting Started

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/siml.git
cd siml
pip install -e .
```

Run a simulation:

```bash
siml run examples/hello_world.siml
```
